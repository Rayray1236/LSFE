<h2><b>Welcome to the Automating of a Lighting System For The Elderly and Sick people</h2></b>
<p><b>What is Automated Lighting System</b> An Automated lighting system enable recall and selection of scenes with 
the press of a button, instantly customizing the lighting to accommodate different preferences and different uses of the space.</p>
<p>The capabilities of lighting-control systems have evolved beyond adjusting output and turning lights 
on and off.Today systems can adjust light-source color, including shades of white light, and generate data by measuring and 
monitoring.The advantages of lighting systems are well-documented. By reducing lighting time, intensity, lighting controls 
reduce both demand and energy consumption for the elderly and sick person.Therefore, the light automatically is measured by 
the sensor and considering the amount of background lights coming from outside, automatically the brightness of lights is 
controlled to reach the preset level that determined for that room. By the means of this method, it is possible to provide 
better user comfort, avoid elderly and sick person forcedness to switch the light on and off, and hence effective energy saving.</p>
