<h2><b>Soultions For Elderly and Sick people</h2></b>
<p><b>The possible solution that of implemented could solve the problem the elderly and sick 
persons are facing are:</p></b>
<p>1. A voice recognition system that could decode human voice could be install.
voice recognition is a computer software program or hardware device with the ability 
to decode the human voice. Voice recognition is commonly used to operate a device, perform 
commands, or write without having to use a keyboard, mouse, or press any buttons. Today, 
this is done on a computer with automatic speech recognition software programs. Many ASR programs 
require the user to "train" the ASR program to recognize their voice so that it can more accurately 
convert the speech to text.</p>
<p>2. A smart controlled light switch could be installed, that is operated by a smart sensor chip.
 Smart controlled light switches provide you with new ways to control your home as an elderly 
and sick person in this case for your lighting and other switch-wired devices, including fans or 
appliances. They also work with existing "regular" bulbs, so if you have many ceiling lights.</p>
