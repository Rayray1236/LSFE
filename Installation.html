<h2><b>Installation of a Lighting System For The Elderly and Sick people</h2></b>
<p>Old age can be a very challenging phase of life without access to the right tools. 
The older we get, the less energy we have to undertake day-to-day tasks manually. 
However, home automation technologies make it possible for seniors to control appliances, 
security, lighting, and even the temperature in their home through a voice command or push of a button.</p>
<p>Howerver, Internet of things to applications have the potential to improve the quality of life, 
especially for elderly and disabled people. A smart home has been a beneficial system for elderly 
and disabled people. However, there are many innovative gaps to design, develop, install, and 
plugins for improving an intelligent home system. Basic activities should be initially concerned, 
such as electronic control systems, human movement detection, and environment monitor system. There 
are many issues in designing an intelligent home system, such as what the devices need to integrate 
into the system and designing a thin system.</p>
<p>The design and development of the automated light system in a smart home using the Internet 
of things and Mosquitto server. This research aims to design the workflow overview of the automatic 
light system based on sensors, devices, components, and servers. The system achieves the light 
control manually and automatically. MQTT server accomplishes to control and modify any devices in 
the IoT network system flexibly. The system's functionalities achieve, and the motion sensor 
capability is a concern of the sensing range covering the area.</p>
